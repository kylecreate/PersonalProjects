In this challenge you will style a simple bio page, testing you on some of the skills you learned in the last couple of lessons including writing selectors and text styling.

# Project Brief
The following live sample shows a biography, which has been styled using CSS. The CSS properties that are used are as follows â€” each one links to its property page on MDN, which will give you more examples of its use.
    * font-family
    * color
    * border-bottom
    * font-weight
    * font-size
    * font-style
    * text-decoration

In the example, there is some CSS already in place which selects parts of the document using element selectors, classes, and pseudo-classes. Make the following changes to this CSS:
    1. Make the level one heading pink, using the CSS color keyword `hotpink`.
    2. Give the heading a 10px dotted `border-bottom` which uses the CSS color keyword `purple`.
    3. Make the level 2 heading italic.
    4. Give the ul used for the contact details a `background-color` of `#eeeeee`, and a 5px solid purple `border`. Use some `padding` to push the content away from the border.
    5. Make the links `green` on hover.
