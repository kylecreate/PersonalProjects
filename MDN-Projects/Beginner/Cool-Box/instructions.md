# Starting Point
To get this assessment started, you should:
    * Save the HTML and CSS shown below as two separate files — `index.html` and `style.css` — in a new directory.

## Project Brief
Your task is to create a cool, fancy box and explore the fun we can have with CSS.

### General Tasks
Apply the CSS to the HTML.

### Styling the Box
We'd like you to style the provided `<div>`, giving it the following:
    * A reasonable width for a large box, say around 200 pixels.
    * A reasonable height for a large box, centering the text vertically in the process.
    * Center the box horizontally.
    * Center the text within the box.
    * A slight increase in font size, to around 17-18 pixel computed style. Use rems. Write a comment about how you worked out the value.
    * A base color for the design. Give the box this color as its background color.
    * A contrasting color for the text and a black text shadow.
    * A fairly subtle border radius.
    * A 1-pixel solid border with a color similar to the base color, but a slightly darker shade.
    * A linear semi-transparent black gradient that goes toward the bottom right corner. Make it completely transparent at the start, grading to around 0.2 opacity by 30% along, and remaining at the same color until the end.
    * Multiple box shadows. Give it one standard box shadow to make the box look slightly raised off the page. The other two should be inset box shadows — a semi-transparent white shadow near the top left and a semi-transparent black shadow near the bottom right — to add to the nice raised 3D look of the box.
