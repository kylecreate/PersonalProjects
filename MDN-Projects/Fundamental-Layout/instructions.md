# Starting Point
Save the HTML document and stylesheet into a directory on your computer, and add the images into a folder named `images`. Opening the `index.html` file in a browser should give you a page with basic styling but no layout, which should look something like the image below.

This starting point has all of the content of your layout as displayed by the browser in normal flow.

## Project Brief
You have been provided with some raw HTML, basic CSS, and images â€” now you need to create a layout for the design.

### Your Tasks
You now need to implement your layout. The tasks you need to achieve are:
    * To display the navigation items in a row, with an equal amount of space between the items.
    * The navigation bar should scroll with the content and then become stuck at the top of the viewport when it reaches it.
    * The image that is inside the article should have text wrapped around it.
    * The `<article>` and `<aside>` elements should display as a two column layout. The columns should be a flexible size so that if the browser window shrinks smaller the columns become narrower.
    * The photographs should display as a two column grid with a 1 pixel gap between the images.
