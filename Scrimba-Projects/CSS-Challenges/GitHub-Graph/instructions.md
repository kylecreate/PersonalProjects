This challenge is inspired by GitHub's contribution graph.

# GitHub Contributions Graph
* The HTML for the graph is generated by the code in `index.js`. You don't need to worry how the code works (unless you want to!).
* The graph has 7 squares in each column representing each day of the week, and 52 squares in each row, representing each week of the year.
* Style the graph with default squares. Then create selectors that will style each square based on the number of contributions per day. The JS gives code randomly to each square a contribution level of 0, 3, 5, or 10, which is assigned using a data property. The lighter the color, the greater the number of contributions for that day.

## Hints
* This challenge is a really great canidate for CSS grid and the `repeat()` function.
* For styling the squares, look into using attribute selectors.
