Going to be taking the jumbled mess of the HTML code and creating a Four of Hearts card using just CSS. Similairly to the previous project, this is primairly a layout challenge using Grid or Flexbox.

# Requirements
* Match the layout as closely as you can
* Card width should be 2/3 of its height
* Card can be fixed size (does not need to grow and shrink with the browser)
