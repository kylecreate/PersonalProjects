* A portion of a coldered circle spins around clockwise within a grey circle.
* Match styles, but feel free to choose your own colors.
* NO JAVASCRIPT!

## Hints
* Use animation property and keyframes
* Remember that the `border` property is a shorthand to style all four sides of a border at once - you can individually style each side of an element's border using properties like `border-top`, `border-right`, etc..
