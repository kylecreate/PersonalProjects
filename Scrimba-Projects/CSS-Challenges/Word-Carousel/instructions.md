It's using CSS animation and no JavaScript that swaps out the words on a continous loop cadence.

## Word Carousel
* Match styles
* Personalize -- display 4 things you love
* Words should rotate in an infinite loop
* NO JAVASCRIPT!

## Hints
* You can define the steps of an animation in keyframes using percentages, with 0% being the beginning of the animation and 100% being the end of the animation.
* Think about how you can use a pseudo element's **content** property to swap words.
