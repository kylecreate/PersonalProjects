This project has a lot of real-world applications that come along with it. You can use it to build a flashcard app, memory game, card gallery layout, and more.

## CSS Card Flip
* Card has two sides, and flips from front to back on hover.
* Match styles as closely as you can
* CSS ONLY! NO JAVASCRIPT!
* Don't worry about responsiveness

## Hints
* A card flip is essentially an element rotating 180deg in 3D space. Use `.card` class to create the flip effect, then show and hide the front and back content as the card flips.
* Use the transition property for a smooth flip.
* The cross properties `transform-style:preserve-3d` and `backface-visibility` will help you along the way.
