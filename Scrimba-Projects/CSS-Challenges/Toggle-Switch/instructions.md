Going to be creating a classic toggle switch that is possibly seen throughout the internet.

Toggle Button
* On click, toggle switch moves from one side to another.
* Cursor becomes a pointer
* Match styles
* NO JAVASCRIPT!

Hints:
    * If you hide the checkbox, you'll still be able to style and toggle back and forth between `input:checked` and `input:unchecked` pseudo class by clicking on the checkbox label.
    * Use a sibiling selector to style the `.toggle-switch` class when the input is `:checked` or `:unchecked`.
