In this project, you are required to create a simple datepicker UI using only HTML and CSS. It will not be a functional datepicker, but a static UI component that you can later enhance with JavaScript.

The goal of this project is to help you practice positioning, layout, and styling techniques in CSS. Below is a rough mockup showing the datepicker UI you need to create.

Feel free to customize the colors, fonts, and overall design to match your style.

While this version wonâ€™t be functional, it will provide a solid foundation for creating an interactive datepicker in a future project.
