In this project you are required to create a simple component for a website that displays a changelog. A changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project or software. It is often used to keep users informed about the latest updates and improvements.

The goal of this project is to teach you about positioning and layout in CSS. You will create a simple HTML structure and use CSS to style it into a visually appealing and responsive changelog component. Given below is a rough mockup of the changelog component you need to create.

Feel free to customize the design and layout of the component as you see fit. The focus should be on creating a well-structured and responsive component that can be easily integrated into a website.
